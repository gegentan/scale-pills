Requires [Pehkui](https://modrinth.com/mod/pehkui)!

I wanted a mod that changes your size using pehkui, but I couldn't find one. So I made one! (And parallelly learned fabric modding)

All my insipiration came from [Chiseled Me](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chiseled-me)

Currently has:
- Reset Pill (Resets your scale)
- Upscale Pill (Scales you up. Has the sizes 2x 4x 8x 16x and 32x)
- Downscale Pill (Scales you down. Has the sizes 2x 4x 8x 16x and 32x)
